UTILITY # SYMPTOM\PROBLEM DESCRIPTION                       GN:DW:PC:
------- - -----------------------------------------------   -- -- --
ASM-86  1 Does not diagnose unterminated "IF" conditional.   *  *  * 
V1.1        

        2 The  DW codemacro specifier/modifier  used with    *  *  *
          a  range-check does  not reject  out of  bounds
          parameters in some cases.

        3 The  DW  codemacro used with a range check does     *  *  *
          not accept a negative range boundary.   
          WORKAROUND: Use "Dsb" (signed byte).

ASSIGN    There are no known problems.                             *
V1.0

BDOS    1 At the CCP level, typing K:<return>, where K is    *  *  *
V2.2      a non-existent disk, causes  the  "BDOS SELECT"
          message to appear, but a control-C then results 
          in the K> prompt.          

        2 FFFF in  "max"  field of code group  descriptor    *  *  * 
          causes faulty  allocation;  it  should allocate
          all of available memory.

        3 During  BIOS SELDSK does not set bit 0 of DL to    *  *  * 
          0  if  the  first  access  of  the  drive is  a 
          simple default drive switch.  

        4 Function 59 does not work properly.                      *
          WORKAROUND: Install CP/M 86 Patch 13

BIOS    1 Redirection does not work properly.                      *
V1.2

CONFIG    There are no known problems.                             * 
V1.0

COPYDISK  There are no known problems.                          *
V1.5

COPYDISK  There are no known  problems.                      *     *
V2.0

DDT 86  1 After tracing through a PUSHF, a G command will    *  *  
V1.1      go into trace  mode.

        2 Files are not closed after  an R or E  command,   *  *   
          even if an error occurs.

        3 IN  AL,0  and  IN  AX,0   are  disassembled  as   *  *    
          the same command.                                              
                                                                     
          Note:  DDT 86  was  updated  to V 1.2 in August             
          of  1982 however,  the  CP/M  86 (product 1007)            
          master was not updated.                                    

DDT86     There are no known problems.                             * 
V1.2

ED      1 Command tail, "MYFILE.TXT B:YOURFILE.TXT"  does    *  *  * 
V2.0      not create resultant file on B:  as the  manual           
          says.                                               
                                                                     
        2 nJ  string ....  does  not  function   properly,   *  *  * 
          WORKAROUND: J command works if the "n" parameter           
          is omitted.                                                

FUNCTION  There are no known problems.                             *

-
GENCMD  1 Cannot build 64K segments;                         *  *  *  
          WORKAROUND: Limit segments to 62K

        2 Certain .H86  records can  cause erroneous .CMD    *  *  *    
          file to be built.

GENDEF  1 Hangs on certain input files.                      *

        2 Concatenating  console  input with  an  exiting    *  *  *      
          disk file does  not  work  at  all,  regardless 
          of the destination.
          WORKAROUND: Pip filename1 = con:
                      then Pip file3 = filename1,file 2

PIP     1 Files which have the archive bit set  are not            *
